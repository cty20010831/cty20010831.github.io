title: Comparative Analysis of Language Models in Word Prediction (From Traditional Probabilistic Models to Recurrent Neural Networks)
summary: This project for CMSC 35620 course that compares traditional probabilistic model (N-grams) and modern connectionist model (LSTM) models in next word prediction task. Specifically, this project compares their accuracy and perplexity for ”clean” data, as well as their ability to handle linguistics noise (spelling errors and masked words).
