# [Personal Webpage](https://cty20010831.github.io)
This repository is used to create my personal academic website using [Hugo Academic CV Theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv).

## View and Edit Website
View and edit the github website on the fly by the following command:
```bash
hugo server -D
```
Hugo will provide a link (e.g. http://localhost:1313/) to open in web browser.

## Update Github Website
After pushing changes to this github repo, go to `Actions` section and `Deploy website to GitHub Pages` subsection and then click `Run workflow` to update changes to the personal website. See below:
